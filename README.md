## psuedo code
1.) i need to make a multiple choice quiz
2.) when I click start the quiz should start and the countdown timer will initiate.
3.) when the user responds with a click on an answer it needs to react.
4.) if the answer is correct, it should respond with a "correct!" statement.
5.) if it is wrong, it needs to respond with a "incorrect!" statement and deduct time from the timer.
6.) when the user chooses option, move to next question to display
7.) when the quiz is finished it needs to record the results and show them on the screen. the results is how much timer is left.
